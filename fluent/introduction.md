#### A fluent mapping driver for Doctrine2

This mapping driver allows you to manage your mappings in an Object Oriented approach, by implementing FluentMapping and EmbeddableMapping interfaces.

The package also provides a fluent Builder over Doctrine's ClassMetadataBuilder, aimed at easing usage of Doctrine's mapping concepts in Laravel.
